# cassandra-spark-ansible

This repository contains an Ansible playbook that sets up an Apache Cassandra and Apache Spark cluster.

Please see the related blogpost for more details: https://opencredo.com/deploy-spark-apache-cassandra/

Note that this is intended to be a demonstration and it **does not** set up a production-quality, 
well-tuned and highly available environment. It is intended to be a demonstration and provide a quick-start
for anyone who wants to try the functionality of such a setup.
